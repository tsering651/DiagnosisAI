# Diagnosis AI

Diagnosis AI project aims to develop an AI-powered diagnostic assistant to revolutionize disease detection processes. Traditional diagnostic methods face challenges such as time-consuming procedures, high costs, and potential errors. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, Diagnosis AI automates and streamlines diagnostics.

Using diverse medical image datasets, including those for brain tumors, nail diseases, lung cancer, and breast cancer, the project trains AI models to accurately identify disease patterns and features. The algorithmic approach integrates advanced image processing techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with transfer learning enhancing efficiency. Image augmentation and exploration of alternative architectures like RCNN ensure robustness.

To improve model interpretability and transparency, **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is integrated into the system. This technique highlights the regions in medical images that most influenced the AI's predictions, helping users and practitioners understand the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision.

The project culminates in a user-friendly web portal for disease screening, offering rapid, accurate assessments. Additionally, the project conducts a comprehensive investigation into image processing and machine learning techniques for disease detection, focusing on skin cancer, brain tumor, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Methodologies, datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics are explored, with model performance analysis and reflections on implications and future research directions concluding the study. Diagnosis AI endeavors to transform disease diagnosis, improving patient outcomes and advancing healthcare technology.
